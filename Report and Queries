Relational Data Model

Assumptions/Notes About Data Entities and Relationships

•	Assumptions/notes about Entities and data relationship:
•	 List Registration Table has listing id, listing_url and name and each listing id represents a unique Airbnb room which is mentioned in listing_url
•	 Each listing id has unique Description id associated with it. 
•	So, one to one relationship exists between List Registration Table and Description Table (Cardinality)
•	Every listing id should have a description id (Modality = 1)
•	 All listing id has experience level as 1. So, many-to-one relationship exists Description table and     Experience table and every record has in description table has an experience Id i.e. (Modality= 1)
•	  Each promotion id is linked to only one Promotion id. So, one-to-one Relationship is there  between the two tables. Modality of both tables is 1 and 
•	Description id, neighborhood_overview, notes, transit, thumbnail_url, medium_url in Promotion table have null values
•	 Each promotion id is linked to only one Host id. So, one-to-one Relationship is there between the two tables. Modality of both tables is 1 
•	 In Host AIRBNB table and HOST Table, many to one relationship exists( because same host can post advertisements on different dates). And the Modality of host_id in Host table can be 1. 
•	host_about, host_response_time, host_response_rate	host_acceptance_rate can have null values
•	 Between Host AIRBNB table and Location verification table – one to one relationship exists. Modality of 1
•	 Location verification table and Property and room type table have many-to-one relationships. Every Location id have Property and room type so MODALITY is 1. 

•	 Location verification table and room_type table have many-to-one relationships. Each Location id have Property and room type so MODALITY is 1.

•	 Accommodation availability table and Host AIRBNB table has one to one relationship. And every record of Accommodation availability table has one row connection, so Modality is 1. 

•	 Accommodation availability table and Bed Type has many-to-one relationship. And modality is 1.

•	 FEE AND SERVICE TABLE and Host AIRBNB table has one to one relationship with modality is 1.

•	weekly_price, monthly_price, security_deposit, cleaning_fee has null values

•	 DAY NIGHT CAPACITY TABLE and Host AIRBNB table has one-to-one relationship and modality is 1

•	 TIME PERIOD AVAILABILITY TABLE and Host AIRBNB table has one-to-one relationship with Modality as 1.

•	 Review Score Table and Host AIRBNB table has one-to-one relationship with Modality as 0 because all multiple records in Review Score Table are null which doesn’t provide any significance.

•	review_scores_rating, review_scores_accuracy, review_scores_cleanliness, review_scores_checkin, review_scores_communication, review_scores_location, review_scores_value, reviews_per_month can have null values

•	 Review frequency Table and Host AIRBNB table has one-to-one relationship with Modality as 1

•	number_of_reviews, first_review, last_review have null values

•	 Strictness Table and Host AIRBNB table has one-to-one relationship with Modality as 1.

•	Review_table and Reviewer_table has one to one relationship

•	Review_table and LR_table  has one to one relationship

•	List Registration table and Listing_detail table has one-to-many relationship.




Include reasons why the data model is in 3NF.

This meets the 3NF requirement because the non-key attributes are not dependent on any other non-key attribute. Hence, overcoming transitive dependency.







Entity-Relationship Diagram

 




Assumptions/notes about data:
Procedure Followed for normalization
•	 The raw data provided in Kaggle has many redundant rows and noise. We first convert the raw data into normalized form
•	After converting into 1NF, we make sure to decompose the 3 xlsx files into multiple tables to obey the condition for 2NF. Here, we make sure the non-key attributes solely depend on the primary key or composite primary key
•	The last step to filtration is checking for 3NF. The non-key attributes must not be dependent on the other non-key attributes.






Assumptions/notes about data
•	Assuming that the attributes in the entities which are missing implies that user/host isn’t interested in knowing/providing that info. So, those values can be filled with null values in MySQL Workbench.
•	 As web scrapping tool is used to get the dataset on Kaggle and it’s a SINGLE value so we can eliminate the column’s  scrape_id, last_scraped.
•	 Pictures of Airbnb listing are in listing_url where images of facilities provided can be found so we can eliminate the Datathumbnail_url, medium_url, picture_url, xl_picture_url columns.
•	 host_response_time can be removed as host_response_rate and host_acceptance_rate provides numerical values for the “Response time of host “ 
•	 host_verifications and host_has_profile_pic are not useful to make decisions.
•	 neighbourhood, neighbourhood_cleansed, neighbourhood_group_cleansed are not relevant to frame the relations between tables because they provide any useful infoormation
•	 market, smart_location, country_code, country attributes are repeated attributes so using those to make a entity isn’t required. An individual would buy an item from its “City market” which is already in host_location.
•	 square_feet attribute is NULL so didn’t considered it for ER Diagram and many more. 
•	 price attribute doesn’t convey what AIRBNB is charging that amount for 
•	 calendar_updated (NON- NUMERIC) which doesn’t imply numerical values for How many days before calendar was last updated 
•	 calendar_last_scraped isn’t needed as it’s related to web scraping date 
•	 requires_license, license, jurisdiction_names, instant_bookable attributes aren’t useful
